## Business Need & Purpose
As an investment lending broker, getting actionable information how you need it, when you need can be a challenge. This is the foundation of a bigger project vision. With this site a client can register with our office and submit a pre-qualification application for our office to evaluate client's loan needs, loan type, property type, and property information for analysis. 

Future build out will provide API interaction with CRM, Email, Real Estate sites, and provide research tools such as calculators for wholesale, rehab estimates, and purchase/exit strategies.

Additional functionality plans include Draw Requests, Project Insurance Requests, and Proof of Funds letter requests for current clients.
